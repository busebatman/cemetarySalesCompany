                                                  CEMETARY SALES COMPANY
In this project we are designing a cemetary sales company in Istanbul. People can buy graves before or after death. And they can buy personal or family graves. There are certain number of graves in a cemetary. A family grave is up to 4 person. If a family is less than 4 person and wants to buy a family grave, they stil have to buy a 4 person family grave. Graves have different prices for their category.
The company provides also funeral transport services for the dead customer.
With additional cost, company also offers grave care service (cleaning, watering and flower planting at desired periods).
Scope of the Project:

Our company provides grave selling service to our customers in Istanbul and takes the funeral from its place to the grave with special transportation vehicles. Also gives grave care service at desired peroids with additional cost.
The database contains information about graveyards, graves (family or singular), person [employee (office worker, driver or cleaner), customer (dead or alive)], grave care service, material (cleaning or planting), supplier and cars (staff car or hearse).
With the web application, we can see the datas in the database, also we can add a customer to the database.
